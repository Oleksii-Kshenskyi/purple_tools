# Purple Tools

This is a collection of various Python automation scripts I use daily in my work and life. The development has just started. Updating this README and the repo's documentation in general is one of the tasks that should be completed before the end of February 2020, so please be patient!

## Licensing:

Purple Tools is licensed under BSD 0-clause license. This means that you are free to do **whatever you want** with the application. You **don't have any obligations** if you want to use Purple tools. You don't even have to reproduce any copyright notices in your code if you're using the code from Purple Tools in your projects (like you would have had to if it was under MIT for example). Enjoy!

## First Stage:
- Time calculation utilities:

  a. Conversions between Pomodoro 25 minute units and time strings;
  
  b. Adding and subtracting time;
  
  c. Difference between dates (in years/months/weeks/days);
  
This may be it, requirements may be adjusted on the fly.
