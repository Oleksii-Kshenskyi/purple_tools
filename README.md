# Purple Tools

This is a collection of various Python automation scripts I use daily in my work and life. The development has just started.
## First Stage:
- Time calculation utilities:
  a. Conversions between Pomodoro 25 minute units and time strings;
  b. Adding and subtracting time;
  c. Difference between dates (in years/months/weeks/days);
  d. Timers with clocking in and clocking out.

This may be it, requirements may be adjusted on the fly.
